## What is a smart question?

Eric Steven Raymond wrote a whole essay on smart questions and how to write them that can be found here

[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

While his essay goes over every single thing that you should know when asking technical questions there were a couple a big key points. Some of those big key points include trying to figure out the answer yourself before asking questions, asking questions in a relevant location, properly formatting your question, giving the important details and making it easy to respond to your question. There are many more things one should know but these basics get you the general idea for writing a smart question. By attempting to solve the problem yourself and then adding what you did in those attempts in your question you are more likely to get an answer to your question. This is because you will be seen as someone who is willing to put in the work and just having a little trouble vs someone who is just too lazy to find the answer themself. Picking the proper location to voice your question is very important because you need to ask the question to people who would have answers for it. If you asked a question about python in a forum about java you are unlikely to get an answer from someone very knowledgable in python and even if there is a person with that knowledge they are not on the java forum to answer questions about python. You need to ask the question in a way that makes it appealing to answer. Supplying the proper information and steps you have already taken to solve the problem make your question easier to solve and therefore more likely to be solved. On the opposite side leaving out important information and details will make your question less appealing and therefor less likely to be solved. Finally you need to make it easy for people to reply to your question or else people wont be able to help you even if they know the answer. By utilizing these ideas you will be able to create smart questions that will get smart answers.
