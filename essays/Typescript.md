## My Feelings On Typescript

Overall I am liking Typescript. It is similar enough to Java, which I am very strong with, that I know how to do a lot or can figure it out very easily. The fact that variables can auto determine type is cool though it does keep tripping me up because I am so used to writing int in a for loop whereas now I am writing let. I cannot think of a single feature I would consider worse than java. Though some differences are not better, they are not worse either, at least in my opinion. The only way I can discribe it, is that it feels more fluid than coding languages I am used to. I do not have as strong of feelings to ES6 but I believe that stems more from the fact that it strays further from the Java style so I am less knowledgeable in how it works.

## My Feelings On Athletic Software Engineering

When I first heard the idea I though it was terrible because being told that I am going to be repeatedly put in a stressfull situation does not sound appealing. That said after doing a couple practice WODs I realized I was not really going to be as stressfull as described. I like coding and even though I might not be able to do all the WODs fast enough I am looking forward to the opportunity to try. It looks like there is going to be a lot of substance to the work in the class because of this ASE method which I generally prefer so overall I am optimistic.
