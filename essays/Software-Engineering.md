## Why Am I Interested In Software Engineering?

I am interested in software engineering because it is a part of computer science and I want to learn as much about computer science as possible. Having learned what I will be doing in the ICS 314 course I did get more interested because I like learning new coding languages which I will be doing and I get to develop things that will help me professionally. I like that I will be making my own website to use as a resume as that will look good to employers. 

## What Experiences And Skills Do I Hope To Develop?

I hope develop my experience with different coding languages as I am really only proficient in Java as of the writing of this essay. I thoroughly enjoy learning new coding languages so it will be fun and helpful. I am also looking forward to learning how github works as I have been wanting to learn that for a while but never got around to it. Seeing as github is so important it is a skill I feel is necessary.

I also hope to improve my ability to work under pressure through the workout of the days. I have not been able to work well under stressfull conditions consistantly so I hope to get better at that. I also hope the 314 course will also help develop my ability to work on one thing for a long period of time. I have trouble focusing on something for more than a few hours so improving my ability at that is important to me.
