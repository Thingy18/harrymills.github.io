## Have you been using design patterns?

If you have never heard of design patterns than your first reaction might very well be to say no. That was my first reaction because when I heard those words I thought they meant some sort of preset outline for writing code and I don't follow any outlines when writing code. But design patterns are really just concepts for how you structure your code. For example a Singleton pattern refers to classes that can be instantiated once and then globally accessed throughout an entire application. Reading that I bet a great many coders would say that they have done that at least once in their coding experience. I know for certain that I have done it on numerous occasions.
