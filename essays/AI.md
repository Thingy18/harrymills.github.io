## The role of AI in education

Over the past couple of years AI has reshaped how higher learning can be done especially in the software engineering field. It is important to note that it is not a replacement for higher learning but rather a new tool that can further learning. The goal of computer science classes has never been to teach specifics for every coding language. That is simply impossible. My father, who has been in the field for probably around 25 years, is constantly learning new things because new things are being created every day. Concepts have always been the focus of computer science classes and learning concepts is the key to properly utilizing AI for computer science. My experience in using both ChatGPT and Github Copilot has taught me that you do not need to know how specific lines of code work to use them. You just need to know how the pieces fit together to create something.

## My experience with AI

### Experience WODs
For E18 I copied the instructions into ChatGPT and then asked it to write out the totalDegrees function. 
### In-class Practice WODs
### In-class WODs
### Essays
### Final project
### Learning a concept / tutorial
### Answering a question in class or in Discord
### Asking or answering a smart-question
### Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
### Explaining code
### Writing code
### Documenting code
### Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”

## The impact of AI on learning

My use of AI in ICS 314 has been extensive but to really examine it I have to go back to my ICS 111 class last year. I knew most everything that occured in that class already because I had taken quite an extensive list of computer science classes in high school. We were encouraged in that class to utilize AI particularly ChatGPT as that is the way of the future for computer science but I was resistant to change a coded all of my assignments by hand because I felt like AI was kinda cheating. Then I took ICS 211 and things changed. Suddenly there was a lot of knew concepts and code to be learned that took a while to learn. I did not have a lot of free time on my hands so I started using ChatGPT. What I came to realize was that I was not cheating by using AI. It was a tool that I used but I still needed to know the concepts I was applying or else I would not know why things where not working. And now going into ICS 311 and 314 this semester I started out with a much different perspective on AI that has drastically shaped how I went about school work. I probably could not hand code out any of the functions utilized early in 314 or the webpages that we focused on later but I could get any function we talked about written out in typescript in about a minute using AI. I also could tell you how those functions worked in a general sense (though likely not line by line).
