## My experiences and thoughts on Bootstrap 5 

So far I have made 4 webpages with Bootstrap 5 and I have had the same experience with all of them. Note that these are not complete working webpages, they are just made to look like an example page. With the help of github copilot I could very easily setup the overarching structure for each different part of my webpage but then trying to format anything inside those parts was a nightmare. The reason for this is most of the actual text on the page had to be nested within 4 or more tags. Most of those were divs but ul and li came up frequently for the navbars. And each tag had at least 1 Bootstrap 5 class though a good chunk had more than 1. Each time I wanted to change the format of something I would have to run the html code, use the inspect tool on chrome to bring up that code on the page, wade through each layer of tags until I found which 1 I needed to change and then figure out the css code needed to actually make the change. Most of the time I would have to close and rerun the html code several times tweaking the code in between each time until I actually got it to look how I wanted it to look. That whole process is very time consuming not to mention frustrating. In addition I often do not know what most of the Bootstrap 5 classes being implented actually do because github copilot gets me close to what I actually need and then trial and error gets me close enough to what I need. Close enough being the keyword because I can never get things perfect. To see what I mean take a look at the image below which is a replication of the website this essay is on made using Bootstrap 5

<img width="1000px" class="text-center p-4" src="../img/Bootstrap5webpage.png">

If you pull up a side by side of the original and that image you will see that everything is just a little bit off. It took me about 2-3 hours to make that page and of that maybe 15-20 minutes was me writing out the HTML side of the code and the rest of that time was spent trying to format things. I should clarify that writing out the HTML code entirely consisted of me hitting tab when github copilot suggested things and then deleting a couple of tags. Most of the formatting troubles came from trying to figure out exactly which tags I needed add the Bootstrap 5 Justify-Content classes to which was surprisingly difficult. I got things to look alright but I was generally upset I could not get a couple of things to look perfect.

## Is Bootstrap 5 useful?

After the scathing review I have just given I am guessing any one reading this essay might be suprised that my answer is Bootstrap 5 is groundbreakingly useful. This is contingent on the use of github copilot or a similar ai being used with it.
