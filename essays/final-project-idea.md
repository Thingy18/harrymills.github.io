# The problem and solution

Throughout my 2 and half semesters attending UH Manoa I have consistently had trouble knowing the dates and times of important events. The reason for this is the sheer number of different sources I have to shift through to find out those dates and times. It could be a University wide holiday so there is no class, it could be a professor has decided not to have class that day and only communicated that in a single spoken sentence I missed, there could be a social event communicated through one of a dozen different email accounts that I do not have the time to look at and much more. The point is there is no one place I can go to look for information. Creating a public calendar that any professor and other official clubs or university service would have access to.

# Approach

There would be filters for different categories of information and sources. So one could filter for things about classes posted by professores for instance. Students could set up email and text message notifications. There would be options for posts to link to an email or webpage so that the information does not need to be repeated in multiple locations. The goal would not be to have the actual information on the calendar but rather it would be a nexus to learn of the existence of the information. 

# Mockup page ideas

Student page. Authorized poster page. Notification page. Calendar page.

# Use Cases

It would be filtered for a particular student so for instance if a professor has decided to cancel class for a day they could set up a message for every student enrolled in that class that it is canceled. Another example use case would be student housing services being able to post an announcement that emails of housing contracts have been sent out. I would not necessarily hold the actual information but be able to point out that the info has been sent out and where it can be found.

# Beyond the basics

Some more advanced features could include more automatic collection of information such as having automated systems to make notifcations about emails or making it a more universal place for information to be distributed instead of just being a collection of links.
