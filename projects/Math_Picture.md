summary: "As a project in my pre calc class in highschool I created an image in a graphing program using math equations"
---

My partner and I used the graphing program on a website called Desmos to create an image using many different equations that would be graphed. We picked an image of a stormtrooper helmet from Star Wars as our image and found a picture on the internet that would be used as a outline. We then made equations with the lines limited by x and/or y values so they would only overlap the image and not go any farther.
