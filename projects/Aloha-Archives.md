summary: "For the final project in ICS 314 my group created a website that holds important public information about Hawaii"
---

The goal of the project was to create a way to easily access public record information from one central location. The information varies from tourism statistics to covid-19 data. I joined the group for the final project but they had already done most of the work as they had created the project for the HACC initially.

Personally I fixed several problems that the website was facing. I made it so the cards that represent each set of data where all set to the same height and would line up properly. I also fixed a width error the contact page had.
