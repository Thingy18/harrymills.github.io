summary: "For the final project in my advanced programming topics class in highschool I coded a Pokemon Damage Calculator in Java"
---

When run the user would be given a pop up menu with several different options including quiting the program, checking certain details of a move or a pokemon or setting the information for the calculation. The bare minimum of information was the name and level of the pokemon attacking and the pokemon being attacked as well as the name of the move used to attack. To get a more accurate calculation other information such as the ability of the pokemon or an item being held by the pokemon could be provided. The end result would give the range between the highest and lowest possible numbers as there is a random multiplier in the calculation of damage in pokemon games. To make the experience as easy as possible there was 11 text files written with all the relevent information related to pokemon, moves, items and abilities so that all the user would have to do is enter things that they should know like names, and they would not be required to know the actual numbers behind everything.

The project was done over the course of my second semester junior year of highschool. Including blank lines there is around 1800 lines of code written excluding test code and a class I wrote to help me with the text files. All of the text files are just big lists of information used in the calculations. Most of them were copied from the internet and then modified for useability in my code. I want to be clear I was not plagiarizing work but copying information, such as a list of all pokemon and their base stat values. All the code was written by me. Because the text files were copied information they were generally not formatted in a usable way so I would either hand edit them or for many of them I wrote and then modified for each use case a class called pdfChanger that would edit the files for me.
