summary: "As a project in my US history class in highschool I did a documentary on a spy from WW2 codenamed Garbo"
---

I made a video which included pictures, me providing information and parts of a recorded interview I did with an author named Nigel West who cowrote a book with Juan Pujol Garc√≠a aka agent Garbo. I describe details of his early life, his actions in WW2 and his accolades from both the allies and the axis (yes he did recieve awards from both). There is nothing from his post WW2 actions because there is really nothing of note.

I used a video editing software called clipchamp to record and edit my project. I had a zoom call that I record with Nigel West that I used parts of in my video. Most of my information was researched before my interview with him but he would end up confirming all of it.
